# borah-specs

This repository holds the history of the Borah HPC cluster specifications.
Tags are used to discern each change to the configuration of the cluster.  The
changes may include expansion of the base cluster, addition of condominium
nodes, or removal of expired nodes.  A master record DOI is available at the
[Albertsons Library Site](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/oit/3/).  A
textual description of the current configuration can be found on the
[RCS Website](https://www.boisestate.edu/rcs/hpc/).

The following are links to specific tags/dates of the configuration history.

<table>
<tr><th>Date</th><th>Tag</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td>2020-05-01</td><td>TBD</td><td>Initial configuration</td></tr>
<tr><td>2020-10-01</td><td>TBD</td><td>Addition of GUTT compute node</td></tr>
<tr><td>2021-01-25</td><td>TBD</td><td>Addition of NAM GPU node</td></tr>
</table>

The detailed specifications are in the `borah.yml` file, and should represent
the cluster based on the tag(s) above.  To inspect the specifications at the
cluster at a point in time, click the tag link and navigate to the `borah.yml`
file for that checkin.
