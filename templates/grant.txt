Borah is a heterogeneous, Intel based compute cluster installed at Idaho
National Laboratory’s Collaborative Computing Center (C3), where Idaho
institutions have been invited to install computing equipment in support of
collaborative research among the universities, Idaho National Laboratory
researchers, and industry partners. The university-owned portion of the cluster
was funded by the Vice President of Research, Vice President of Finance and
Administration, and the Provost. The cluster, including faculty buy-in nodes,
has {{.ComputeCount}} general purpose compute nodes with a total of {{.ComputeCores}} cores and
{{.ComputeMem}} GB of RAM; {{.GPUCount}} GPU nodes with {{.GPUCores}} Cuda cores,
with {{.GPUMem}} RAM each; and {{.HighMemCount}} high memory node, with {{.HighMemMem}} GB RAM.
The cluster is attached to resilient, high-performing Isilon storage that uses
an Infiniband high-speed interconnect.  Borah is accessible via IRON’s (Idaho
Regional Optical Network) 100GB connection dedicated to research and education
which peers with Internet2, the nation’s largest and fastest, coast-to-coast
research and education network.
