Borah is a heterogenous cluster installed at Idaho National Laboratory’s
Collaborative Computing Center (C3), where Idaho institutions have been invited
to install computing equipment in support of collaborative research among the
universities, Idaho National Laboratory researchers, and industry partners. The
university-owned portion of the cluster was funded by the Vice President of
Research, Vice President of Finance and Administration, and the Provost.  The
cluster has {{.NodeCount}} nodes, each with two {{.CPU}} CPUs;
{{.GPUNodeCount}} GPU nodes, each with two {{.GPU}} and {{HiMemCount}} high
memory node, with {{.HiMemRAM}} GB of RAM, and two Intel Xeon Gold 6252 2.1G,
24-core CPUs. The cluster is attached to 730 TB of resilient, high-performing
Isilon storage that uses an Infiniband high-speed interconnect. Borah is
accessible via IRON’s (Idaho Regional Optical Network) 100GB connection
dedicated to research and education which peers with Internet2, the nation’s
largest and fastest, coast-to-coast research and education network.
