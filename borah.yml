# Meta-information for the entire Borah cluster
name: Borah
interconnect: Mellanox Non-Blocking HDR200/HDR100 Infiniband
internet: 100GB ethernet
storage: Dell Isilon
desc: Borah is a heterogeneous cluster installed at Idaho National Laboratory’s
  Collaborative Computing Center (C3), where Idaho institutions have been invited
  to install computing equipment in support of collaborative research among the
  universities, Idaho National Laboratory researchers, and industry partners. The
  university-owned portion of the cluster was funded by the Vice President of
  Research, Vice President of Finance and Administration, and the Provost. The
  cluster consists of general purpose compute nodes, GPU enabled nodes, and
  various special purpose nodes, all x86_64 architecture, and all connected via
  Infiniband interconnect.  The cluster is attached to resilient,
  high-performance storage.  Borah is accessible via IRON’s
  (Idaho Regional Optical Network) 100GB connection dedicated to research and
  education which peers with Internet2, the nation’s largest and fastest,
  coast-to-coast research and education network.
